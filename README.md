# Framework mono-repo
Monorepo of frameworks.

# Starting Development
##  Fork Repository

Under the [zerobias-org/framework](https://github.com/zerobias-org/framework) repo, click the Fork button toward top right of the screen
* Under owner choose your personal account for development, and leave the repository name as framework
* **Make sure the `Copy the main branch only` is unchecked, this is important**
* Click the `Create Fork` button

Once you have forked the repository change, your working environment to the `dev` branch.
* Any PRs made against the `zerobias-org/framework` repo should be agaisnt it's dev branch or they will be rejected.

## NPM Packages authentication
**ZB_TOKEN**

Set `ZB_TOKEN` in your environment variables to authenticate with npm registry.
`ZB_TOKEN` needs to be an API key from [ZeroBias](https://app.zerobias.com).

## Getting Started

**Please run `npm install` in the root directory as soon as the repository is cloned, this will setup husky hooks**

## Creating a new framework

### Run create new framework script

A set of templates and script have been provided to initialize the start of a new framework.

You can run the following command:
```sh scripts/createNewFramework.sh <standard_category> <publisher> <category> <version>```

The variables required are the following:
* `standard_category`: cyber | technical | clinical
* `publisher`: The vendor who published this framework, eg: `nist`
* `category`: The category or suite this framework belows to, eg: `800-53`
* `version`: The version of this framework, which can refer to a v1, a year, or version name, eg: `v1` | `2024` | `rev4`

This will automatically create the folder structures under the package directory and copy in the templates provided
with some minor replacements done.

### Update replacements in index.yml

The index.yml file defines the frameworks main information such as name, description, url, and element types.
You will need to replace any field that has `{field}` in it.
Also please look at the examples framework for information on adding element/mapping types.

### Add elements

Now we can build the elements that make up this framework. These elements may contain folders for structure and
heirarchy with the controls and requirements below them that make up the framework.

The examples framework shows a basic structure with two levels of folders, one control layer, and one control enchancement layer.

You can provide background for examples and more detailed information as well as aliases and more.

### If needed add baselines and baseline elements

Many frameworks also have different baselines within them. For example you may have a `low`, `medium`, and `high` baseline to
denote different coverages of the frameworks.

For each baseline you will create a yml file in the `baselines` folder. Each file contains basic info like name and description
followed by the list of elements that fall into the baseline. You can denote which elements are mandatory or options.

Parameters and requirements are coming soon.

### Additional information

If you have any questions or concerns regarding more needed functionality or assistance, please use the zerobias.org slack for help.

### Install and Shrinkwrap

Run the following commands to update npm for your new framework
* `cd <publisher>/<category>/<version>` cd into your new framework directory
* `npm install` run npm install
* `npm shrinkwrap` run npm shrinkwrap

### Validate new frameworks

In the root of the respository run the follow command to validate all edit or added frameworks
* `npm run validate` If any errors, edit what is needed and rerun

### Open PR against changes

Now you that you have added your new framework you can commit your changes following the instructions below.

**You will then open a PR against the dev branch on the main repository**

If you open a PR against a different branch we will reject it.
Once we have done a simple review we will set a tag to have tests ran.
Community will discuss and review/vote on framework information before being brought into the Zerobias platform.

## Commit conventions and Version management
### Versioning: [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

#### Framework versioning
Framework versions are managed by `lerna`. 
* Add it to [lerna.json](./lerna.json) to enable lerna for a framework.
* The starting version of a framework should be `0.0.0`
* There should be no version bumps inside of pull requests.

Lerna will automatically version, generate changelogs and publish frameworks in `lerna.json` via our github actions workflows.

This works well for any starting version higher or equals to `1.0.0`. For versions that haven't had a major bump yet an additional step is required.

In order for a framework/package to bump to `1.0.0` it must be explicitely told to do so via `premajor` and `conventional graduation`.
These are two lerna terms and re leveraged by our workflows described below.

The former will happen inside of a pull request and generate a release candidate.
The latter will graduate and publish it.

#### Lerna dry run

What lerna does can be simulated using `dry-run`.
* `npm run lerna:dry-run` will generate changelog as well as do local version bumps.
* You may also run `dry-run` on pull requests, for piece of mind, by assigning the p.r. to `nfci`

You may also run the following command to generate a local changelog without using `lerna version`:
```
npx lerna exec --concurrency 1 --no-sort --stream -- \
  conventional-changelog \
    --preset angular \
    --infile CHANGELOG.md \
    --same-file \
    --release-count 0 \
    --lerna-package \$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME \
    --commit-path \$PWD
```

### Github Actions workflows.

Each framework should have one workflow that runs tests on Pull Request.
There are 3 other workflows involved in the publishing process.
* `pull_request.yml`
* `lerna_publish.yml`
* `lerna_post_publish.yml`

#### Pull Request
The `pull_request` workflow triggers when a pull request is `assigned` or `labeled` or `closed`.
* assigned to nfci: runs `lerna dry run`
* labeled as `premajor`: runs `lerna premajor`
* closed by merging:  triggers the `lerna-publish` workflow

#### Lerna Publish
This workflow will run lerna publish against all registered frameworks.
Frameworks that have changed are first bootstraped then tagged and published.
Implicitely this calls the following 2 package.json `scripts`
* `version`: before lerna commits the version change. There, we make sure `api.yml` is also included in said commit.
* `postpublish`: after lerna has published the npm. This triggers the final workflow. `post-publish`

#### Lerna Post Publish
This workflow is used to finalize framework publication. At the moment it:
<!-- * Publishes docs to [docs_cms]( TODO add new docs location here ). -->
* Sends a slack notification.

### Git Hooks: [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

`Husky` has been configured on this repository to perform the following checks before a change is allowed to be commited.

#### Check commit Message Format against conventional commits

Any commit that does not comply with conventional commits will be rejected.

#### Build framework affected by change

The affected framework(s) will be built via `npm run build` and `unit` tested.
Additionally, `eslint` will be executed to catch any linting errors before they make it to a pull request.

The commit will be rejected if any of this fails.

*Example: good commit*
```
touch badcommit.txt
git add badcommit.txt
git commit -m 'this is a bad commit'
⧗   input: this is a bad commit
✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]

✖   found 2 problems, 0 warnings
ⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint
```

*Example: Good commit*
```
touch goodcommit.txt
git add goodcommit.txt 
git commit -m 'feat: some cool new feature'
[MOD-599-readme 4e70f32b] feat: some cool new feature
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 goodcommit.txt
```

### Commit Message Format
Every commit should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).
This section summarizes some of its guidelines.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
Either the **body** or **footer** must begin with `BREAKING CHANGE` if the commit is a breaking change.

Example — `feat(lang): add polish language`

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **test**: Adding missing tests.
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

#### Scope
The scope is optional and could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `release`, `api`, `mappers`, etc...

#### Body
The body may include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
It should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** if not provided in the **footer**.

#### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** if not provided in the **body**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.
A description of the change should always follow.
